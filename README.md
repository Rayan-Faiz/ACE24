# Patient Monitoring and Localization System  

## Overview  
This project is a patient monitoring and localization system designed to enhance the safety and well-being of individuals with cognitive disorders. By real-time tracking, the system ensures that caregivers can respond quickly to potential risks, such as erratic movement or crossing defined safe zones.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitor patients' locations in real time using GPS.  
- **Geofencing**: Define and manage secure zones for each patient.  
- **Alerts**: Detect unusual movements and send predictive alerts.  
- **Data Visualization**: Historical movement patterns for detailed analysis.
