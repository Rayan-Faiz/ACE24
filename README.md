## Software Architecture
![software architechture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f9c50c2-bd4a-4fe2-a010-eb778c1fb3a5)
This app has 4 microservices:

Authentication Service: For user authentication and login.
Patient Service: Manages patient details and their safe zones.
Location Service: Tracks GPS locations of patients from IoT devices.
Alert Service: Checks if patients are out of their safe zones and sends notifications.
The app is built with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend.

Frontend Interaction:

Caregivers use the React frontend to log in, manage patients, view their locations on a map, and see notifications.
Data Flow:

GPS devices send patient location data to the Location Service.
The Alert Service processes the location data and checks against safe zones.
Notifications are displayed in the caregiverâ€™s dashboard.

## Technology Stack:

Backend: Spring Boot (4 services)
Frontend: React
Database: MySQL (shared by all services)
Communication: Feign (for service communication)
Service Discovery: Eureka
